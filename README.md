## 🔬 Research Focus & Expertise

My research centers on developing formal guarantees for complex, dynamic, and collaborative robotic systems. The core expertise includes:

| Area | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Formal Guarantees** | CBF (Control Barrier Function)-enabled safety for Reinforcement Learning (RL) policies deployed on dynamic systems. |
| **Nonlinear & Constrained Control** | Robust, adaptive, and constraint-based control techniques for uncertain, delayed, and highly dynamic systems (MPC, Adaptive Control). |
| **Dynamic Coordination** | Coordinated control of heterogeneous mobile manipulators, aerial robots, and legged systems for collaborative tasks (e.g., payload transport). |
| **Shared Teleoperation** | Hierarchical shared control architectures for safe, remote human-robot interaction and inspection in challenging environments. |
